## Overview
COMP47650 - Term Project (IMDB Movie Review- Sentiment Analysis)
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sentiment of a given movie review as either positive or negative. This involves processing and analyzing large volumes of text data, implementing machine learning algorithms, and evaluating the performance of the models. The project provides an opportunity for students to develop their skills in natural language processing, machine learning, and data analysis.
